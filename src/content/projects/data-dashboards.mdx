## Overview

I created lightweight dashboards that surface key metrics at a glance while keeping interactions calm and fast.

## What I Did

- Built responsive tables, filter controls, and summary cards with empty/loading states.
- Introduced quick search, column sorting, and CSV export affordances.
- Designed visual hierarchy that keeps important numbers obvious without noise.

## How I Did It

I kept dependencies lean—semantic HTML elements handle most heavy lifting, and charts are progressive enhancements layered with dynamic imports. Server-rendered data hydrates instantly and updates without jank.

## What I Learned

Dashboards require balancing density with clarity. I refined strategies for handling loading seams, no-data states, and large dataset pagination.

## Outcome

The dashboards respond quickly, communicate clearly, and help stakeholders make decisions with confidence.
