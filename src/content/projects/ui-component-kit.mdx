## Overview

I pulled common UI patterns into a lightweight component kit so new pages stay consistent with minimal effort. Each primitive is tuned for this design system and ships with sensible defaults.

## What I Did

- Audited the site for repeating patterns that were worth abstracting.
- Built button, card, grid, and toast primitives with variants and states.
- Documented usage and props inline to speed up future development.

## How I Did It

Components rely on Tailwind utilities and composable props so consumers can extend them without overrides. Accessibility stayed front-and-center—every control ships with focus styles, keyboard interactions, and contrast-checked palettes.

## What I Learned

Design systems are a balancing act. I practiced keeping APIs small yet expressive and learned where to stop abstracting to avoid harming flexibility.

## Outcome

Shipping features now feels faster and more cohesive. The shared kit reduced duplication and ensured new work keeps the same polished feel.
