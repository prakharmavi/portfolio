## Overview

This portfolio highlights my work, writing, and experiments. I rebuilt it from the ground up with a focus on performance, clarity, and long-term maintainability.

## What I Did

- Designed the information architecture and responsive layout.
- Implemented the hero experience with interactive 3D art and delightful details.
- Created accessible navigation and contact flows, including spam-resistant forms.

## How I Did It

I leaned on Next.js App Router with React Server Components for most pages, colocated UI primitives, and used Tailwind for styling. Content lives close to the code so updates stay simple, and image assets are optimized with `next/image`.

## What I Learned

Crafting smooth animations and typography across breakpoints takes iteration. I refined patterns for layout composition, image optimization, and ergonomic content structures that age well.

## Outcome

The result is a fast, minimal portfolio that clearly tells my story and is easy to extend as new projects and notes ship.
