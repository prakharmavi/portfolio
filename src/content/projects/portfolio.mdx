A performance-focused portfolio built with Next.js 15 and React 19 — structured project storytelling, a verified contact workflow, and an embedded AI chat.

## The Problem

Most developer portfolios are either over-engineered with unnecessary animations, or under-designed with basic HTML. I wanted something in between — professional, fast, and just interactive enough to stand out without sacrificing load times.

## What It Does

### Project Case Studies
Projects are authored in MDX with frontmatter metadata. The system automatically generates SEO metadata, renders a card grid on the home page, creates individual `/projects/[slug]` routes, and processes Markdown with syntax highlighting.

### Contact Workflow
Protected by Cloudflare Turnstile (CAPTCHA alternative) with Resend for email delivery:
1. User fills out form (name, email, message)
2. Turnstile challenge validates client-side
3. Server verifies token with Cloudflare API
4. Message sent via Resend to configured inbox
5. Confirmation email sent to user
6. Rate limiting prevents spam (10 messages/hour/IP)

### Additional Features
- **Cal.com integration** — Floating booking button for scheduling calls
- **Pronunciation helper** — Audio playback for name pronunciation
- **AI chat** — Embedded Fastman chat for interactive Q&A
- **Social links** — GitHub, LinkedIn, Discord with custom icons
- **Tech stack icons** — Visual representation of core technologies

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend

**Next.js 15 (App Router)** — React Server Components for reduced client JS. Server Actions for form handling. Automatic code splitting and lazy loading.

**React 19** — Concurrent rendering, `useActionState`, `useFormStatus`, enhanced Suspense boundaries.

**Tailwind CSS v4** — Utility-first styling with custom UI primitives. `class-variance-authority` for component variants. `tailwind-merge` for className composition.

### Contact & Verification

**Cloudflare Turnstile** — Invisible CAPTCHA alternative. Privacy-focused (no Google tracking). Server-side token verification.

**Resend Email API** — Reliable delivery with template support and bounce handling.

### Content Management

**MDX** — Markdown with JSX component support. `@next/mdx` for Next.js integration. Frontmatter metadata extraction for automatic SEO and routing.

## Key Decisions

**Why Next.js 15?** — The App Router's RSC architecture reduces client-side JavaScript significantly. Most of the site is server-rendered, with only interactive elements hydrated on the client.

**Why MDX for Projects?** — Best of both worlds: Markdown's simplicity for writing, plus the ability to embed custom React components when needed.

**Why Turnstile over reCAPTCHA?** — More privacy-friendly (no Google tracking), better UX (often invisible), and free for unlimited verifications.

## Performance

```
Code Splitting
├── Optional libraries excluded unless explicitly enabled
├── Route-based splitting via App Router
└── React.lazy() + Suspense for heavy components

Image Optimization
├── All images through next/image
├── Automatic WebP conversion
├── Lazy loading with blur placeholders
└── Responsive srcset generation

Font Loading
├── System font stack as fallback
├── font-display: swap for custom fonts
└── Subset fonts to reduce file size
```

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|-------|------|
| **Framework** | Next.js 15 (App Router) |
| **UI** | React 19 + Server Components |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS v4 |
| **Content** | MDX with dynamic imports |
| **Contact** | Cloudflare Turnstile + Resend |
| **Scheduling** | Cal.com Embed |
| **Animation** | Framer Motion |
| **Icons** | Lucide React |
| **Deploy** | Vercel (Edge Runtime) |

## Challenges Solved

**Turnstile Integration** — Needed custom error handling for token expiration (90s timeout), network failures during verification, and race conditions between widget load and form submit.

**Rate Limiting** — In-memory rate limiting with a Map-based store. Works for serverless but won't scale across regions — production should migrate to Redis or KV store.

**Contact Form UX** — Clear feedback at every step: loading state during submission, success confetti animation, error messages with retry option, email confirmation for peace of mind.

## Lessons Learned

**MDX frontmatter makes content management feel like a CMS** without the overhead. Define your project metadata schema early.

**Turnstile verification is surprisingly easy** compared to reCAPTCHA. Less code, better UX, no tracking.

**React Server Components dramatically reduce client JavaScript** when used correctly. Most pages ship zero JS.

**Form UX matters more than form validation.** Clear feedback builds trust. Users should never wonder "did it work?"
