## Hello

I’m Prakhar — a software developer focused on building fast, thoughtful experiences. I enjoy transforming ideas into products that feel polished, accessible, and easy to maintain.

- Shipping UI that balances aesthetics with performance.
- Collaborating closely with product and design to move fast.
- Sharing notes so others can reuse the patterns that work for me.

Outside of work, you’ll find me experimenting with motion design, reading about developer tooling, or coaching newer engineers through tough technical problems.
