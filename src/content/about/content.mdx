# Hi, I’m Prakhar

I’m a **Computer Programming diploma graduate** (Seneca, Toronto). Not an “engineer,” not a theorist — I’m a builder. I care about taking messy ideas and turning them into clear, working software people can actually use.

## What I’m good at
- **Full‑stack shipping** — Next.js/React, TypeScript, Node, Postgres, iOS (Swift & React Native), Redis/Valkey.
- **System design** — turn requirements into primitives, APIs, and workflows that scale.
- **Execution speed** — build → test → instrument → iterate. Always biasing toward shipping.

## Principles I live by
- **Taste over hype** — boring tools if they win.
- **Latency is UX** — speed is the product.
- **Privacy first** — minimal data, minimal third‑parties.
- **Real > perfect** — shipping teaches more than stalling.

**Based in Toronto · from Delhi**
