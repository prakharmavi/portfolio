I’m a Seneca Computer Programming grad (Toronto).

I’m the guy who gets annoyed when something is 1.5 seconds slower than it needs to be.
Because users feel that. And they leave.

I don’t do “big brain architecture” for fun. I do simple systems that ship and don’t break the minute real traffic hits.

## What I’m good at
- Full-stack shipping: Next.js/React, TypeScript, Node, Postgres
- Mobile shipping: Swift + React Native
- Making apps survive: Redis/Valkey, caching, background jobs, queues

## My default mode
Build the first working version fast.
Then tighten it:
- cleaner data model
- better error handling
- retries where it matters
- logging so debugging is not guesswork
- performance work because slow UX is fake UX

## My rules
- boring tools if they win
- speed is part of the product
- collect the minimum data needed
- ship, learn, improve

If you want a “builder energy” dev who can take a rough idea and turn it into something real, that’s me.
